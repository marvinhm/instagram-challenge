Instagram Challenge
===================

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using React. **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Styled like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## How to start

1. Produce some stories, break them down into tasks, and estimate
2. Fork this repo, clone, etc
3. Initialize a new rails project

Remember to proceed in small steps! Getting confused? Make the steps even smaller.

## Code Quality

For linting, I am using the `prettier`

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
