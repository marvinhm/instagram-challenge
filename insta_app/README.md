Finstagram Challenge
===================

I am building an Instagram clone. It will allow **Users** to be able to post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Styled like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

## Tech

Finstagram uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

#### Codebase
* [React] - For logic and JSX enhanced for web apps!
#### Test Framework
* [Jest/Enzyeme] -  for BDD testing purposes, unit and feature tests.
#### Code Quality
* [Prettier] - For linting
#### Database
* [Postgres] - relational database management system!
* [Table Plus] - GUI tools to create, access, query & edit multiple relational databases
